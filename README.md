Ive decided that the robot arm Im making is going to be a fatory arm. Basically something that would be part of an asssembly line. The base joint of each finger can rotate 360 degrees so that it can
change the position of the fingers based on what it's picking up so that it can get a decent grip, I've also added a divot a the base of the arm so that the base joint of the arm can rotate a little
bit farther than it could without it. I'm also going to model the elbow like a ball joint but still have it act like a hinge.

I added indents to the base fo the finger joints as well so that they would be able to bend farther without clipping into the hand part. I also added some deatil bits on the base arm part. I decided
to keep the detail to a minmum because When I added more it looked a little to fancy to be a factory arm and it was starting to get a bit farther from the smoother design I had in mind.
